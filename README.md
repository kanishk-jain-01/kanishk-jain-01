## AI Engineer | GauntletAI Cohort 2 

Welcome to my Github Portfolio. Below are some of the projects I have spearheaded and am proud to share. 

### Genius Reads: A Better Way to Read Technical Material

GeniusReads is an AI-powered PDF reader designed for technical learning that combines document viewing with intelligent conversation and automatic knowledge extraction. Users can highlight text passages, ask questions about the content, and engage in AI-driven discussions that help deepen understanding of complex technical materials. The application automatically extracts key concepts from these learning sessions using LangGraph workflows and OpenAI, building a searchable knowledge base with vector similarity matching for discovering related ideas across documents. Built with a sophisticated multi-language architecture using Rust (Tauri) for performance, Python for AI processing, React for the UI, and PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search capabilities.

### ScioScribe: AI Agents That Help You Plan, Execute, and Analyze Experiments 

ScioScribe is an AI-powered research co-pilot that revolutionizes scientific experiment design and data analysis through sophisticated multi-agent AI systems built with LangGraph and OpenAI GPT-4. The platform features three specialized agent teams that collaborate to guide researchers through experiment planning, conversational data cleaning, and automated visualization generation using a modern React/TypeScript frontend and FastAPI backend. The system implements human-in-the-loop workflows with real-time WebSocket communication, CSV versioning with AI change tracking, and an intelligent conversation interface that processes natural language queries into actionable data transformations. ScioScribe streamlines the entire research lifecycle from hypothesis formulation to publication-ready visualizations, empowering researchers to focus on insights rather than tedious data manipulation tasks.
